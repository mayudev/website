First, you might be wondering why I used such a weird domain: `mayu.gay`. Well, it's only because they were giving out .gay domain names for free. I was really surprised to see no one took `mayu.gay` before me. And... honestly, it's not like I hate this domain. I might even consider renewing it next year (although $30 is quite expensive :/)

Anyway, I used Next.js to make this website. I think it's a very awesome framework and I will use it again in my future projects. Since it's a small website with a limited number of pages, they're all statically generated and work without JavaScript!

The only caveat is that the theme switcher won't work, but I think the default [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) theme is awesome enough.

I'm quite proud of how this website turned out, even if it's not flashy as other portfolio websites. I wanted to keep it simple, but also somewhat fancy, and I think I managed to do just that.

Still, I have pretty much nothing to show off here, so I wouldn't call it a portfolio website. But at least I have a few ideas for new blog posts. So you might want to check this site every now and then...

Anyway, see you again.
